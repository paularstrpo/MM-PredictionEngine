GLI1	SHH Inhibitor	expression	activating	over-expression	sensitivity	Dysregulation of the hedgehog signaling pathway plays a major role in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma. Pre-clinical studies have shown that hedgehog inhibition reduced the potential of stem cells to initiate leukemia in vivo in mice, and reduced cell proliferation in multiple myeloma cells. Treatment of hematological malignancies via hedgehog inhibition has been evaluated in various clinical studies to date, most of which have been conducted in the context of myelodysplastic disease, myelofibrosis, CML, or AML. GLI1 mRNA expression has been found in pre-treatment samples of AML patients, and expression of GLI1 has been correlated to hedgehog inhibition response via phase I/II studies in solid tumors, as well as in AML.	31125907;32054823;22821765;31036756	
GLI2	SHH Inhibitor	CNA	activating	amplification	resistance	Dysregulation of the hedgehog signaling pathway plays a major role in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma. Amplification of downstream HH genes, especially GLI2 as a mechanism of resistance has been reported for vismodegib and sonidegib in cell culture and mouse studies in some solid tumors, as well as in hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. Amplification of GLI2 via overexpression or copy number amplification has been correlated with tumor growth in a Smo-independent manner.	31576013;22821765;31036756;32371475;31125907

Treatment of hematological malignancies via hedgehog inhibition has been evaluated in various clinical studies to date, most of which have been conducted in the context of myelodysplastic disease, myelofibrosis, CML, or AML. PTCH1 upregulation has been correlated to overall hedgehog activity in myeloma and has been suggested as a potential biomarker for hedgehog inhibitor response through pre-clinical cell culture and mouse experiments, as well as with treatment response in the context of AML	31125907;32054823;22821765	
SMO	SHH Inhibitor	somatic mutation	deactivating	D473H	resistance	Dysregulation of the hedgehog signaling pathway plays a major role in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma. Defective SMO via the aquisition of mutations has been reported as a mechanism of resistance to hedgehog inhibition in several solid tumors, with some mechanistic mouse and cell culture experiments suggesting that this mechanism is also potentially relevant in multiple myeloma.	23662017;25008467;31125907;22821765	
BRCA2	PARP Inhibitor	somatic mutation	deactivating		sensitivity	Genomic instability is a hallmark of myeloma that is present both at the early stages and throughout progression of the disease. PARP inhibitors, which act by targeting increased genomic instability, have been FDA-approved for the treatment of BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer, as well as ovarian and lung cancer. High-throughput studies have shown that loss of BRCA confers increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors as tumor cells are unable to deal with the increase in lethal DSBs associated with replication fork collapse. Several preclinical and phase I studies have shown that genomic instability via defective BRCA sensitizes multiple myeloma to PARP inhibition in vitro. The safety and efficacy of syngergistic treatment with proteasome and PARP inhibition has been tested in a phase I clinical studies in myeloma with promising results and is being further evaluated in further studies.	32194286;26719576;32373151;21917757;32826945;29467487;32194286	possible synergistic w/ proteasome?

TSC1	MTOR Inhibitor	somatic mutation	deactivating		sensitivity	The protein products of tumor supressors TSC1 and TSC2 form an intracellular complex exerting GTPase-activating activity towards a small G protein Rheb. Inhibition of Rheb is important for the positive regulation of mTOR pathway, while mutations of hamartin or tuberin result in uncontrolled cell cycle progression. TSC1 and TSC2 are direct regulators of the MTORC signaling pathway in myeloma cells and have been shown to regulate growth, proliferation and differentiation of plasma b-cells in the bone marrow. While the use of TSC1/TSC2 mutational status have not been evaluated as a biomarker for everolimus response in hematological malignancies, there have been several genomic biomarker studies in solid tumors demonstrating predictive value of TSC1/TSC2 mutations for sensitivity to MTOR inhibition.	22923433;30396185;26000908;30705387;21674478;31389395;32927859;26859683

NRAS	MEK + pan RTK Inhibitor Combination	somatic mutation	activating		sensitivity	In multiple myeloma the mutational profile is mainly represented by translocations involving chromosome 14 and by single nucleotide mutations, frequently involving genes implicated in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, as KRAS, NRAS, and, less frequently, BRAF.  There have been several cell line, genomic, and case studies to suggest that the targeting of NRAS or KRAS mutations by MEK inhibition is also supported in multiple myeloma.	31709194;26228812;32747568;28504689

BRAF	MEK + BRAF + pan-RTK Inhibitor Combination	somatic mutation	activating	V600E	sensitivity	In multiple myeloma the mutational profile is mainly represented by translocations involving chromosome 14 and by single nucleotide mutations, frequently involving genes implicated in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, as KRAS, NRAS, and, less frequently, BRAF.  BRAF V600E mutations have been correlated with worse prognosis and overall survival (OS) in patients with multiple myeloma and occur in approximately 3-9% of patients with myeloma. There have been few studies evaluating the use of dabrafenib, an inhibitor of BRAF, to target V600E mutations in myeloma, including a case study of a patient treated with dabrafenib and trametinib who experienced a significant and rapid reduction in plasmacytomas, as well as a single patient enrolled in the MATCH trial sub-protocol H who attained minimal response to dabrafenib and trametinib. There is also some pre-clinical evidence that targeting BRAF alterations is plausible in myeloma, especially in the context of targeting overall MAPK pathway dysregulation.	23928771;29807803;32747568;33123389;32758030	
BCL2	BCL2 Inhibitor	expression	activating	overexpression	sensitivity	The overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2 are hallmarks of cancer and favor tumor cell survival and resistance to therapy. Venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor, is FDA approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but the drug has shown activity in a number of hematological malignancies, including relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Furthermore, several studies in multiple myeloma have established BCL2 over-expression as a potential marker for sensitivty to venetoclax in the context of multiple myeloma.	26939706;30076373;30428277;33737856	
IDH1	IDH Inhibitor	somatic mutation				The IDH1 and IDH2 genes encode enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes, including adaptation to hypoxia, histone demethylation and DNA modification. IDH inhibitors and the utility of IDH mutations as a marker of response have been well characterized in gliomas, where the drug is currently approved for use. In hematological malignancies, IDH inhibitors are mostly being evaluated for use in AML, with relatively few studies in multiple myeloma. However, there is increasing evidence for a role of abberant epigenetic programming in cell differentiation and proliferation in myeloma cells. Furthermore, there is also some recent, limited evidence through cell line experiments suggesting that IDH inhibition may target abberant methylation and metabolism in multiple myeloma.	27721426;30455381;33462210	possible synergistic w/ proteasome?

	CDK Inhibitor	translocation	translocation	t(11;14)	sensitivity	The G1 phase of the cell cycle begins when D-type cyclins, including CCND1 and CCDN3, bind to and activate CDK4 and CDK6. This complex then phosphorylates the Rb protein, leading to E2F transcription factor activation and and synthesis of proteins involved in the subsequent steps of cell cycle progression. CDK4/6 inhibitors typically work by binding to the ATP pocket of the kinase, preventing downstream hyperphosphorylation of Rb and thus arresting the cell cycle. In myeloma, CCND1 and CCND3 are typically activated in patients that present with t(6:14) and t(11:14) translocations, respectively. CDK4 inhibition has been evaluated in several pre-clinical and phase I/II studies in patients with multiple myeloma. For example, a 2015 phase I/II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of palbociclib with bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, with objectivge responses achieved in 5 (20%) patients, and stable disease attained in 11 (44%). Biomarker and pharmacodynamic measurements revealed that palbociclib inhibited CDK4/6 and cell cycle at first in most patients, however the utility of cyclin-D translocations has not been specifially evaluated as a response marker in hematological malignancies. Still, given the mechanistic role of CCND1 and CCND3 in cell cycle dysregulation in myeloma, as well as the mechanism of action for CDK inhibition, there may be a role for targeting CCND1 and CCND3 translocations through CDK inhibitors such as palbociclib in patients with myeloma.	25395429;26841010;22718837

CCND3	CDK Inhibitor	somatic mutation	activating		sensitivity	Translocations including t(4;14), t(6;14), t(11;14), t(14;16), and t(14;20) place oncogenes, such as CCND3, under the IgH gene enhancer and lead to overexpression. Though initially designed for breast cancer, Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor by binding to the ATP pocket of the kinase and preventing downstream hyperphosphorylation of Rb and thus arresting the cell cycle. A 2015 phase 1/2 study aimed to study the safety and efficacy of palbociclib with bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, where Phase 2 revealed that objective responses were achieved in 5 (20%) patients; 11 (44%) attained stable disease and biomarker and pharmacodynamic measurements revealed that palbociclib inhibited CDK4/6 and cell cycle at first in most patients. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTANs) linked to Palbociclib leads to degradation of CDK4 and 6, and cotreatment of ARV-771, which is a bromodomain extraterminal protein proteolysis-targeting chimera (BET-PROTAC), with Palbociclib induced apoptosis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma cells in vitro.	34071228; 30587529; 6626550; 25813205; 28663582; 22718837	cdk^ -> cyclin^ ; activation of both of these as a way to target cell cycle dysreg? Activation of CDK4/6
CDK4	CDK Inhibitor	somatic mutation	activating		sensitivity	Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are serine/threonine kinases that regulate progression through the cell cycle, complexing with specific cell cycle regulatory proteins called cyclins. CDK4/6 inhibitors typically work by binding to the ATP pocket of the kinase and preventing downstream hyperphosphorylation of Rb and thus arresting the cell cycle. A 2015 phase 1/2 study aimed to study the safety and efficacy of palbociclib with bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, where Phase 2 revealed that objective responses were achieved in 5 (20%) patients; 11 (44%) attained stable disease and biomarker and pharmacodynamic measurements revealed that palbociclib inhibited CDK4/6 and cell cycle at first in most patients.

CDKN2A	CDK Inhibitor	expression	deactivating	under-expression	sensitivity	CDK2NA functions as a negative regulator of the cell cycle, binding and blocking CDK4 and CDK6 activity in the G1 cell cycle phase as a tumor suppressor gene. Functional loss of CDK2NA has been correlated with response to CDK inhibitor treatment in various solid tumors through clinical trials, as well as in some case reports and phase I/II studies in hematological malignancies.	11556834; 30545397; 29110637; 12745272;31709901;33416096;26715889

CDKN2A	CDK Inhibitor	germline mutation	deactivating		sensitivity	CDK2NA functions as a negative regulator of the cell cycle, binding and blocking CDK4 and CDK6 activity in the G1 cell cycle phase as a tumor suppressor gene. Germline CDKN2A (9p21) allelic loss has been previously reported in patient samples and human myeloma cell lines, and two case reports have reported loss of CDKN2A in patients with multiple myeloma. As functional loss of CDK2NA has been correlated to CDK inhibitor response as an established biomarker in various solid tumors and myeloma clinical trials, deleterious germline variants in this gene may have utility in predicting response to palbociclib.	11556834; 30545397; 29110637; 12745272;31709901;33416096;26715889	
PIK3CA	PI3K Inhibitor	somatic mutation	activating		sensitivity	Pictilisib inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and prevents downstream activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, commonly dysregulated in patients with multiple myeloma. Previously, a clinical trial has found limited efficacy and tolerability of combination MEK/PI3K inhibition in solid tumors, and Pictilisib as a PI3KCA inhibitor has been implemented in the context of bladder cancer and melanoma in the preclinical setting. Moreover, in vitro, Pictilisib (aka GDC-0941) as a single agent can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of MM cell lines and patient myeloma cells; in vivo, the drug has anti-proliferative effects on tumor growth and increases the activity of dexamethasome and lenalidomide to inhibit tumor growth. There may be promise in investigating the utility of pictilisib in the context of PI3KCA in myeloma.	31020608; 33916289; 30237495; 29322846; 23318440; 24405121; 31164152; 28808038	
PIK3CA	PI3K Inhibitor	somatic mutation	activating		sensitivity	Idelalisib is PI3K inhibitor that binds and blocks catalytic activity at the ATP domain of PI3K. Previous studies have shown that the PI3K pathway is constitutively activated in myeloma cells, and most primary myeloma samples from patients with MM exhibit activated AKT phosphorylation. Thereby, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway has contributed to successful treatment of MM, and the utility of idelalisib has been investigated in various phase 3 clinical trials for hematological cancers.	26818003; 34069564; 27334854; 33516721	maybe add pathway activation?
PIK3CA	PI3K Inhibitor	somatic mutation	deactivating	H1047R	sensitivity	Dactolisib (BEZ235) functions as a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. In vivo models of MM have shown that dactolisib has anti-tumor effects along with potentially favorable impacts on osteolytic bone disease. Previously, gene expression of PI3KCA has been found to be higher in MM compared to normal subjects. While Dactolisib and PI3KCA have not been correlated in prior studies, preclinical studies in solid tumors have suggested a possible relation. Specifically, one study using a HER2+ breast cancer cell line transduced with PI3KCA H1047R found that dactolisib was effective in inhibiting growth of H1047R mutant-containing cells: PIK3CA H1047R induces resistance to lapatinib and trastuzumab in HER2 positive breast cancer cells, but resistance can be reversed by dactolisib.	19010894; 25179233; 24405121	
PTEN	PI3K Inhibitor	CNA	deactivating	deletion	sensitivity	PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates AKT phosphorylation in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Because of interconnections in the PTEN-PI3K signaling pathway, functional loss of PTEN tends to lead to hyperactive PI3K signaling in various cancers, including multiple myeloma. Previous studies have shown that the PI3K pathway is constitutively activated in myeloma cells, and most primary myeloma samples from patients with multiple myeloma exhibit activated AKT phosphorylation. Furthermore, PTEN-null myeloma cells are stringently dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway activation for cell survival, suggesting potential for targeting PTEN loss via PI3K inhibition. PI3K/Akt inhibitors have been studied at both the preclinical level with animal and cell line models, and in various phase I/II/III clinical trials in hematological malignancies, including myeloma with demonstrable safety and efficacy.	19010894;24405121;25773992;16112193;24405121;33448321

PTEN	PI3K Inhibitor	expression	deactivating	under-expression	sensitivity	PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates AKT phosphorylation that acts anti-apoptotically. Because of interconnections in the PTEN-PI3K signaling pathway, functional loss of PTEN tends to lead to hyperactive PI3K signaling in various cancers, including multiple myeloma.Previous studies have shown that the PI3K pathway is constitutively activated in myeloma cells, and most primary myeloma samples from patients with multiple myeloma exhibit activated AKT phosphorylation. Furthermore, PTEN-null myeloma cells are stringently dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway activation for cell survival, suggesting potential for targeting PTEN loss via PI3K inhibition. However, in vitro studies have suggested that alterations of PTEN are not common in MM patients, and PTEN deletions tend to occur in advanced disease as secondary events in MM pathogenesis. Knockdown experiments of MIR25 have shown that it functionally targets PTEN by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Upregulation of MIR25, on the other hand, has been correlated with improved prognosis and has been inversely correlated to PTEN expression, suggesting a potential for targeting the MIR25/PTEN axis via PI3K inhibition.	25773992;33448321

However, in vitro studies have suggested that alterations of PTEN are not common in MM patients, and PTEN deletions tend to occur in advanced disease as secondary events in MM pathogenesis. Knockdown experiments of MIR25 have shown that it functionally targets PTEN by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Upregulation of MIR25, on the other hand, has been correlated with improved prognosis and has been inversely correlated to PTEN expression, suggesting a potential for targeting the MIR25/PTEN axis via PI3K inhibition.	25773992;33448321	perhaps also possible to look at MIR25:PTEN expression ratio?
NTRK1	TRK Inhibitor	fusion	activating	fusion	sensitivity	Rearrangements involving the neurotrophic receptor kinase genes 1-3 (NTRK) produce oncogenic fusions in a small proportion of patients with hematological cancers. One preclinical study estimated that 0.1% of patients possessed these fusions, yet these fusions had greater responsiveness to TRK inhibition in vitro and in vivo in a patient-derived xenograft, leading authors to conclude that TRK fusions can predict clinically significant therapeutic responses to TRK inhibition. As larotrectinib selectively inhibits TRK, NTRK fusions may serve as a valuable biomarker for the drugs' application. Moreover, in solid tumors, a Phase 1/2 study of 55 patients with TRK-fusion positive tumors were given Larotrectinib, and the majority of patients experienced a response, with 17/23 patients with NTRK1-fusion showing maximum percent change in tumor size between -30% and -100%.	29920189; 32471990; 29466156

	FGFR Inhibitor	translocation	translocation	t(4;14)	sensitivity	FGFR3 is up-regulated as a result of the t(4;14) translocation that occurs in up to 20% of multiple myeloma patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that up-regulation of FGFR3 promotes cell survival, growth and drug resistance in malignant plasma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In solid tumors, phase I/II results from the NCI-MATCH clinical trial have shown that FGFR inhibition has better efficacy in patients with severely dysregulated FGFR signaling, however, further studies are needed in hematological malignancies. A recent mechanistic study has proposed that FGF trapping in myeloma occurs through c-Myc degradation-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, further supporting a rationale for the targeting of FGFR3 upregulation in the context of t(4;14) translocations and upregulated FGFR signaling. 	22961061;32094301;32463741;21316102

WNT10A, ETV7, DUSP1	XPO1 Inhibitor	selinescore signature	activating 	over-expression	sensitivity	The upregulation of WNT10A, ETV7, DUSP1 define a novel prognostic genetic signature that is predictive of response to selinexor, an XPO1 inhibitor. This ad-hoc signature was derived from analyzing the transcriptomic correlates of response to selinexor from 100 patients with MM from the Phase III BOSTON study, in which weekly bortezomib, selinexor, and dexamethosone lead to an ORR of 76.4% among the treatment group and significantly longer PFS. This signature was further validated using patient data from those enrolled in the Phase II STORM study, as well as those who receiving treatment for MM at Mount Sinai Hospital. While the molecular characterization of this upregulated gene panel has yet to be elucidated, this gene signature has been observed among patients with glioblastoma in the KING study, suggesting a potential biological mechanism that influences cancers' response to XPO1 inhibition.
