t(11;14)	translocation	translocation	CCND1					good prognosis	15%	t(11:14) transolcations have been identified in approximately 15% of patients with multiple myeloma.	Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain on chromosome 14 are hallmarks of multiple myeloma pathogenesis. The translocation of this locus with chromosome 11 leads to overexpression of the oncogene CCND1.	"When present, this alteration is typically associated with better outcomes, including longer PFS and OS."	28561668	
t(6;14)	translocation	translocation	CCND3					good prognosis	5%	"t(6:14) transolcations are relelatively rare in multiple myeloma, occuring in approximately 5% of patients."	Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain on chromosome 14 are hallmarks of multiple myeloma pathogenesis. The t(6:14) translocation leads to overexpression of the oncogene CCND3.	"When present, this alteration is typically associated with better outcomes, including longer PFS and OS."	28561668	
t(4;14)	translocation	translocation	MMSET					adverse prognosis	15%	t(4:14) translocations have been identified in approximately 15% of patients with multiple myeloma.	"Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain on chromosome 14 are hallmarks of multiple myeloma pathogenesis. The t(4:14) translocation leads to overexpression of oncogenes on chromosome 4, including MMSET and FGFR3. Upregulation of MMSET typially results in epigenetic reprogamming, leading to downstream effects including altered adhesion, enhanced growth, and increased cell survival."	"When present, this abnormality is associated with poor prognosis, with shorter PFS and OS."	28561668;30587529	
chr13 deletion	CNA	deletion	RB1	chr13	q			neutral	45-50%	"Monosomy of chromosome 13 is relatively common in patients with multiple myeloma, presenting in approximately 45-50% of the patient population."			28561668	
chr1q gain	CNA	gain	CKS1B;MCL1;BCL9;ANP32E	chr1	q			adverse prognosis	35-40%	"Gain of the chromosome 1q locus is a common abnormality in multiple myeloma, occuring in approximately 35-40% of the patient population."	"Gain of chromosome 1q has been associated with an adverse outcome, although given the large number of genes situated on this chromosome, it is less clear which gene is responsible. Implicated genes at the most commonly gained locus (1q21) include BCL9, MCL1, CKS1B, and ANP32E."	"When present, this abnormality is associated with poor prognosis, with shorter PFS and OS."	28561668;30587529	
t(14;16)	translocation	translocation	MAF					adverse prognosis	5%	"t(14:16) translocations are a relatively rare alteration in multiple myeloma, occurring in approximately 5% of the patient population."	"Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain on chromosome 14 are hallmarks of multiple myeloma pathogenesis. The translocation of this locus with chromosome 16 leads to overexpression of the oncogene MAF. Upregulation of MAF has been associated with genomic instability, as well as mutational signatures that are associated with increased activity of the RNA-editing enxyme APOBEC, leading to more mutations. Additionally, MAF has been demonstrated to mediate resistance to proteasome inhibitors."	"When present, this abnormality is associated with poor prognosis, with shorter PFS and OS."	28561668;30587529	
t(14;20)	translocation	translocation	MAFB					adverse prognosis	1%	This is a relatively rare alteration that presents in approximately 1% of patients with myeloma. 	"Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain on chromosome 14 are hallmarks of multiple myeloma pathogenesis. The translocation of this locus with chromosome 20 leads to overexpression of the oncogene MAFB. Upregulation of MAFB has been associated with genomic instability, as well as with mutational signatures that are associated with increased activity of the RNA-editing enxyme APOBEC, leading to more mutations. Additionally, MAFB has been demonstrated to mediate resistance to proteasome inhibitors."	"When present, this abnormality is associated with poor prognosis, with shorter PFS and OS."	28561668;30587529	
chr1p deletion	CNA	deletion	FAM46C;CDKN2C;FAF1	chr1	p			adverse prognosis	30%	"Deletions of chromosome 1p have been identified in approximately 30% of multiple myeloma cases using cytogenetics, FISH, and comparative genomic hybridization."		"When present, this abnormality is associated with poor prognosis, with shorter PFS and OS."	28561668	
chr17p deletion	CNA	deletion	TP53	chr17	p			adverse prognosis	10%	The loss of TP53 via deletion in chromosome 17p typically presents in approximately 10% of patients with multiple myeloma.	"Del(17p) has been associated with adverse outcome, which is thought to be related to the loss of expression of the tumor suppressor gene TP53."	"When present, this abnormality is associated with poor prognosis, with shorter PFS and OS."	28561668;30587529	
TP53 mutation + loss (bi-allelic inactivation)	CNA + mutation	deletion+mutation	TP53	chr17	p			adverse prognosis	3.70%	The biallelic loss of TP53 is found in appproximately 3.7% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.	"TP53 ""double-hit"" bi-allelic loss has been reported as a particularly high risk subgroup, with a median 18 month PFS and OS of 58%, which is approximately 35% shorter than patients with monoallelic inactivation or wild-type TP53."	"When present, this abnormality is associated with poor prognosis, with shorter PFS and OS."	29967379;31991614;30774775
